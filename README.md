## Advanced Lane Finding
[![Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/github/shield-carnd.svg)](http://www.udacity.com/drive)


In this project, your goal is to write a software pipeline to identify the lane boundaries in a video, but the main output or product we want you to create is a detailed writeup of the project.  Check out the [writeup template](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Advanced-Lane-Lines/blob/master/writeup_template.md) for this project and use it as a starting point for creating your own writeup.  

Creating a great writeup:
---
A great writeup should include the rubric points as well as your description of how you addressed each point.  You should include a detailed description of the code used in each step (with line-number references and code snippets where necessary), and links to other supporting documents or external references.  You should include images in your writeup to demonstrate how your code works with examples.  

All that said, please be concise!  We're not looking for you to write a book here, just a brief description of how you passed each rubric point, and references to the relevant code :). 

You're not required to use markdown for your writeup.  If you use another method please just submit a pdf of your writeup.

The Project
---

The goals / steps of this project are the following:

* Compute the camera calibration matrix and distortion coefficients given a set of chessboard images.
* Apply a distortion correction to raw images.
* Use color transforms, gradients, etc., to create a thresholded binary image.
* Apply a perspective transform to rectify binary image ("birds-eye view").
* Detect lane pixels and fit to find the lane boundary.
* Determine the curvature of the lane and vehicle position with respect to center.
* Warp the detected lane boundaries back onto the original image.
* Output visual display of the lane boundaries and numerical estimation of lane curvature and vehicle position.

The images for camera calibration are stored in the folder called `camera_cal`.  The images in `test_images` are for testing your pipeline on single frames.  If you want to extract more test images from the videos, you can simply use an image writing method like `cv2.imwrite()`, i.e., you can read the video in frame by frame as usual, and for frames you want to save for later you can write to an image file.  

To help the reviewer examine your work, please save examples of the output from each stage of your pipeline in the folder called `ouput_images`, and include a description in your writeup for the project of what each image shows.    The video called `project_video.mp4` is the video your pipeline should work well on.  

The `challenge_video.mp4` video is an extra (and optional) challenge for you if you want to test your pipeline under somewhat trickier conditions.  The `harder_challenge.mp4` video is another optional challenge and is brutal!

If you're feeling ambitious (again, totally optional though), don't stop there!  We encourage you to go out and take video of your own, calibrate your camera and show us how you would implement this project from scratch!

## [Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/571/view) Points

### Here I will consider the rubric points individually and describe how I addressed each point in my implementation.  

## How to write a README
A well written README file can enhance your project and portfolio.  Develop your abilities to create professional README files by completing [this free course](https://www.udacity.com/course/writing-readmes--ud777).

#### 1. Provide a Writeup / README that includes all the rubric points and how you addressed each one.  You can submit your writeup as markdown or pdf.  [Here](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Advanced-Lane-Lines/blob/master/writeup_template.md) is a template writeup for this project you can use as a guide and a starting point.  

You're reading it!

### Camera Calibration

#### 1. Briefly state how you computed the camera matrix and distortion coefficients. Provide an example of a distortion corrected calibration image.

The code for this step is contained in the first code cell of the IPython notebook located in "example_Copy1.ipynb" (or in lines # through # of the file called `part 2`).  

I start by preparing "object points", which will be the (x, y, z) coordinates of the chessboard corners in the world. Here I am assuming the chessboard is fixed on the (x, y) plane at z=0, such that the object points are the same for each calibration image.  Thus, `objp` is just a replicated array of coordinates, and `objpoints` will be appended with a copy of it every time I successfully detect all chessboard corners in a test image.  `imgpoints` will be appended with the (x, y) pixel position of each of the corners in the image plane with each successful chessboard detection.  

I then used the output `objpoints` and `imgpoints` to compute the camera calibration and distortion coefficients using the `cv2.calibrateCamera()` function.  I applied this distortion correction to the test image using the `cv2.undistort()` function and obtained this result:

### Pipeline (single images)

#### 1. Provide an example of a distortion-corrected image.

To demonstrate this step, I will describe how I apply the distortion correction to one of the test images like this one:

![alt text][image2]

#### 2. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you used color transforms, gradients or other methods to create a thresholded binary image.  Provide an example of a binary image result.

I used a combination of color and gradient thresholds to generate a binary image (thresholding steps at lines # through # in `preprocess.py extract_image()` and reference blog :Naoki Shibuya.Finding Lane Lines on the Road). Combination method includes HLS color space segment, x direction sobel operator, y direction sobel operator, sobel gradient magnitude and sobel gradient direction. I find the  HLS color space segment is the key. Here's an example of my output for this step.  (note: this is not actually from one of the test images)

#### 3. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you performed a perspective transform and provide an example of a transformed image.

The code for my perspective transform in the file `preprocess.py perspective_image()` .  The `perspective_image()` function takes as inputs an image (`img`), as well as source (`src`) and destination (`dst`) points.  I chose the hardcode the source and destination points in the following manner:

```python
    point1 = [int(190/960*imshape[1]),imshape[0]]
    point2 = [int(450/960*imshape[1]), int(340/540*imshape[0])]
    point3 = [int(550/960*imshape[1]),int(340/540*imshape[0])]
    point4 = [int(900/960*imshape[1]),imshape[0]]
    src = np.float32([point1, point2, point3, point4 ])   


    point11 = [190/960*imshape[1],imshape[0]]
    point12 = [190/960*imshape[1],0]
    point13 = [900/960*imshape[1],0]
    point14 = [900/960*imshape[1],imshape[0]]
    dst = np.float32([point11, point12, point13, point14 ])
```

This resulted in the following source and destination points:

| Source        | Destination   | 
|:-------------:|:-------------:| 
| 253 , 720     | 253  , 720    | 
| 600 , 453     | 253  , 0      |
| 733 , 453     | 1200 , 0      |
| 1200 , 720    | 1200 , 720    |

I verified that my perspective transform was working as expected by drawing the `src` and `dst` points onto a test image and its warped counterpart to verify that the lines appear parallel in the warped image. When creating the binary image it may prove helpful to create the birds-eye perspective first. The reason is that error pixels in the binary get stretched out when the birds-eye transformation is performed second, as follow picture show:

#### 4. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you identified lane-line pixels and fit their positions with a polynomial?

First, set the left and right center point for finding next window. Next, when window have nonzero pixels, calculate the pixels mean centers. if dont have just follow former center point x value to reduce center point y value for sliding window.Finally, we get points for fitting and my lane lines can be fitted with a 2nd order polynomial kinda like this:

![alt text][image5]

#### 5. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you calculated the radius of curvature of the lane and the position of the vehicle with respect to center.

I did this in lines # through # in my code in `part 8` . Lines 21 to 22 is for calculating radius of curvature, Lines 25 to 30 is for vehicle center position. The radius of curvature  at any point x of the function x=f(y) is given tutorial [here](http://www.intmath.com/applications-differentiation/8-radius-curvature.php). And the vehicle center like this:

```
lane_center = (left_x_int + right_x_int) / 2
image_center = image.shape[1] / 2
offset = (image_center - lane_center) * xm_per_pix
```

#### 6. Provide an example image of your result plotted back down onto the road such that the lane area is identified clearly.

I implemented this step in lines # through # in my code in `part 9` in the function `Lane_Finding_Pipeline()`, all steps as follow.

1.undistort image( line 9)

2.perspective transform image for warpping lane line image(line 10)

3.extract lane line  binary image (line 13)

4.fit the lane line from nonzero binary image(line 19)

5.warped image return original image (line 22 to 32)


Here is an example of my result on a test image:

### Pipeline (video)

#### 1. Provide a link to your final video output.  Your pipeline should perform reasonably well on the entire project video (wobbly lines are ok but no catastrophic failures that would cause the car to drive off the road!).

Here's a [link to my video result](./project_video_result.mp4)

---

### Discussion

#### 1. Briefly discuss any problems / issues you faced in your implementation of this project.  Where will your pipeline likely fail?  What could you do to make it more robust?
in challenge project, using the hsl color space cannot find the line, but using the hsv color space will bring lots noise and make detect unstable. 
i tried to expand roi to make image hold the line parts, but it seems dont work 

Here I'll talk about the approach I took, what techniques I used, what worked and why, where the pipeline might fail and how I might improve it if I were going to pursue this project further.  

1.since the cnn classification ability is good , so i want to try cnn for segment line in complicated situation.

2.Once lines are found they can be used to limit/focus the area of the search in the next frames. So next work is to use the relationship of frame to constrain line region.
